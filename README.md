# movierating-predictions

We are three UCI Data Science students performing an analysis on movie rating predictions based on public opinion data from Twitter and Metacritic. This repository is being used to organize the code for our Data Science Capstone Project. 

There are manual instructions to cultivate the final model and results. 

## Step 1: Vader Sentiment and Word2Vec Word Embedding Calculations

For both the twitter and metacritic data files, the respective files should be run:

2. METACRITIC_vader_word2vec.ipynb
  input files required: sample_metacritic.csv
